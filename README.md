# Documentation = Midterm_Project - FALL 2020 ( Oscar A. Chiqui ) 

For this program use the Pokemon API; https://pokeapi.co/. Which is very interesting since you can create from a database to a library.

My program consists of two parts, part 1 shows a list of 150 pokemon, the list serves as a reference and to know what number the pokemon corresponds.
Part 2 executes a random search or if you see part 1 you write a number and you get the pokemon in the search bar.

# My goal is to create a layout list and use the API to be able to call the server and get results.
